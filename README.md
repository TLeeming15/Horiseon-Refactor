# <Horiseon Website Refactor>

## Description

While the original code for this website was mostly functional apart from a few minor bugs, the HTML and CSS was a little bit messy and long. Another major issue was that it was not following accessibility standards. Firstly,alt tags were added to all images and icons to bring the website up to standard for accessibility. A minor bug with the anchor linkss in the HTML has been fixed, so now all links work. There have pseudoelements added to the HTML to make the functionality more clear to future developers and bug fixers for the site. Lastly, there were a number of instances where CSS code was written twice. This has been consolidated to fit with the best practice codes for web developers. The refactor process was undertaken using this User Story:

### As marketing agency:
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Problems Solved
The website now adheres to accessibility standards. All links work, HTML pseudo elements have been added and CSS consolidated. Using the following Acceptance criteria the refactoring process has been completed:

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## What Did I Learn
Through the refactoring process I was able to consilidate and build upon my knowledge of both HTML and CSS. This process has been invaluable in putting my fingers to the keyboard and theory to the test. My confidence in both HTML and CSS and their partnership has grown vastly through this project. The most important thing I learned would have to be to never write code twice. Try to think about what elements I want to have the same characteristics and use HTML ids or classes to apply these in one code chunk, rather than rewriting the same code for each element. Another area where I gained valuable confidene was in finding answers to problems along the way on my own. To do this I used google often, read documentation, and experimented using DEV tools.
